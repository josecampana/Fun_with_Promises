# Fun with Promises

In spanish from southern Spain (aka andaluz), "ahora después" (literally "now after") is a fuzzy unit time. The meaing of this unit is something in between these two sentences:

- I'll finish it in a few seconds
- You could wait for some years for it

So a **[Promise](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise)** is _something_ (it is an object) it will finish "ahora después" (you don't know when) **but it will finish** (in a good or a bad way).

So, **promises** are a great mechanism to perform **asynchronous operations** (async form now):

- calling an external API
- calling a database
- reading a file

## The basics

## Promise hell

## async/await pattern to the rescue

## Playing with .then() and .catch()

## Running promises in serial

## Running promises in parallel

## Chaining promises

## Real life examples
