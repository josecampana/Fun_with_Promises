# Fun with Promises

In spanish from southern Spain (aka andaluz), "ahora después" (literally "now after") is a fuzzy unit time. The meaing of this unit is something in between these two sentences:

- I'll finish it in a few seconds
- You could wait for some years for it

So a **Promise** is _something_ it will finish "ahora después" (you don't know when) **but it will finish** (in a good or a bad way).
